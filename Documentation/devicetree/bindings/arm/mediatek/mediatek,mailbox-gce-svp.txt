MediaTek GCE Secure Video Path Support Driver
===============

The Global Command Engine (GCE) is used to help read/write registers with
critical time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
vblank. The GCE can be used to implement the Command Queue (CMDQ) driver.
Secure Video Path driver can protect premium video content leakage

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,mailbox-gce-svp"
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "gce" to stand for GCE clock

Example:

	gce_mbox_svp: gce_mbox_svp@10238000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mailbox-gce-svp";
		reg = <0 0x10238000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 154 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&infracfg_ao INFRACFG_AO_GCE_CG>;
		clock-names = "gce";
	};

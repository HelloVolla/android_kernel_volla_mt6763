	---help---
	  Unified RPMB partition interface for eMMC and UFS.
	  Provides interface for in kernel security controllers to
	  access RPMB partition.

	  If unsure, select N.

config RPMB_INTF_DEV
	bool "RPMB character device interface /dev/rpmbN"
	depends on RPMB
	---help---
	  Say yes here if you want to access RPMB partition
	  from user space via character device interface /dev/rpmb%d

	  Be aware this interface may conflict with Mediatek proprietary
	  character device interface for RPMB partition. Select N before
	  conflict is resolved.

	  If unsure, select N.

	select CRYPTO_HMAC
	---help---
	  RPMB partition simulation device is a virtual device that
	  provides simulation of the RPMB protocol and use kernel memory
	  as storage.

	  Be aware it doesn't promise any real security. This driver is
	  suitable only for testing of the RPMB subsystem or RPMB applications

	  Verified Boot 2.0. When enabled, linux kernel sets up dm-verity
	  for protected partitions(system/vendor, etc.) through vbmeta struct
	  instead of original dm-verity metadata.

	  This option is for OTA projects without AVB2.0. For SYSTEM_AS_ROOT,
	  AVB2.0 is mandatory on kernel-4.9+. But it's not possible to add
	  vbmeta partition for OTA projects. This is an alternative feature that
	  embeds main vbmeta, which should be in vbmeta partition, into boot image.

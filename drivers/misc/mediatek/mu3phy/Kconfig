config MU3_PHY
	bool "MU3 PHY"
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables support Mediatek MU3 PHY for SSUSB or XHCI.
	  It support in-circuit PHY and external PHY.
	  Say Y here if your system using SSUSB MAC and PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.

config U3_PHY_GPIO_SUPPORT
	bool "MU3 PHY registers access by I2C"
	depends on MU3_PHY
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables support for read/write PHY registers by I2C.
	  This driver provides interface to interact with USB 2.0 and
	  USB 3.0 PHY that is part of the Mediatek SOC.
	  Say Y here if your system using external Mediatek USB PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.

config U3_PHY_AHB_SUPPORT
	bool "MU3 PHY registers access by AHB"
	depends on MU3_PHY
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables support for read/write PHY registers by internal AHB.
	  This driver provides interface to interact with USB 2.0 and
	  USB 3.0 PHY that is part of the Mediatek SOC.
	  Say Y here if your system using external USB Mediatek PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.

	  This driver provides interface to interact with USB 2.0 and
	  USB 3.0 PHY that is part of the Mediatek SOC.
	  Say Y here if your system using in-circuit Mediatek USB PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.

config C60802_SUPPORT
	bool "MU3 PHY C60802 support"
	depends on MU3_PHY
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables support for external PHY(Ver C).
	  This driver provides interface to interact with USB 2.0 and
	  USB 3.0 PHY that is part of the Mediatek SOC.
	  Say Y here if your system using external Mediatek USB PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.

config D60802_SUPPORT
	bool "MU3 PHY D60802 support"
	depends on MU3_PHY
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables support for external PHY(Ver D).
	  This driver provides interface to interact with USB 2.0 and
	  USB 3.0 PHY that is part of the Mediatek SOC.
	  Say Y here if your system using external Mediatek USB PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.

config E60802_SUPPORT
	bool "MU3 PHY E60802 support"
	depends on MU3_PHY
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables support for external PHY(Ver E).
	  This driver provides interface to interact with USB 2.0 and
	  USB 3.0 PHY that is part of the Mediatek SOC.
	  Say Y here if your system using external Mediatek USB PHY.

config A60810_SUPPORT
	bool "MU3 PHY A60810 support"
	depends on MU3_PHY
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables support for external PHY(Ver A).
	  This driver provides interface to interact with USB 2.0 and
	  USB 3.0 PHY that is part of the Mediatek SOC.
	  Say Y here if your system using external Mediatek USB PHY.
	  If unsure, say N.

config U3_PHY_SMT_LOOP_BACK_SUPPORT
	bool "MU3 ASIC PHY support SMT loop back mode"
	depends on MU3_PHY
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables support for testing SuperSpeed signal is correct.
	  Use to check the USB-C connector is mounted properly.
	  U3 PHY sends a pattern of signal from TX1/2+, TX1/2-.
	  And receive the signal from RX1/2+, RX1/2-. Then
	  verify the signal is correct. If loopback signal is
	  corrent, it means the path from TX to RX is smooth.
	  If unsure, say N.

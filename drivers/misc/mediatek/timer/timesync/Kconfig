config MTK_TIMER_TIMESYNC
	tristate "Time synchronization between kernel sched_clock and sys_timer tick"
	default n
	help
	  This selects the support for time synchronization between kernel
	  sched_clock and sys_timer tick.

	  Time synchronization may be required in some sub-systems, for example,
	  sspm and scp ...etc, to have ability to get the same sched_clock
	  as kernel in AP.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MTK_ARCHCOUNTER_TIMESYNC
	tristate "Time synchronization between archcounter time and monotonic time"
	default y
	help
	  This selects the support for time synchronization between archcounter time
	  and monotonic time.

	  Time synchronization may be required in some sub-systems, for example,
	  camera ...etc, to have ability to get the same monotonic time as kernel
	  in AP.

	  If unsure, say N.
